#summary Sorting Movies & Joining Multi-File AVI Downloads

= Introduction =

Movies is a Post-Processing script designed to be used to process Movies after being downloaded with SABnzbd.

Movies will sort your movies based on Extension, treating AVI Files as SD and WMV/MKV as HD. It will also join 2 AVI movies together to create single AVI file. The Movie file will be renamed & moved to contain the name and the year of the Movie (if the NZB contained that information in the title) - Newzbin downloads work great with this script.
