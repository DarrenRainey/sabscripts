#summary Automatically Download TV Shows from Newzbin RSS Feeds

= Introduction =

SABSync will check your TV directory for the shows you want, downloading only shows that are missing. It supports ignoring seasons for shows that you do not want (you choose the season and that season + all previous seasons are ignored). SABSync will also check the queue for episodes pending to be download (for both NZBs SAB has retrieved the info for and ones still 'fetching') in addition SABSync will check your imported NZB folder to see if that NZB has already been imported (great for times when SAB fails to unpack or rename the download correctly).

Support for most if not all naming conventions that SABnzbd supports (simply copy and paste you TV Renaming string into SABSync's configuration), support for Daily Shows as well.

SABSync is developed in C# Using version 2.0 of the .Net Framework and is limited to Windows (mono on Linux may also work, but this is untested). Thanks to Koonfused (Kay.One) for the assistance in developing this great application.

SABnzbd 0.5+ is required to use SABSync, due to the way the Queue Check is being done as well as the support for priority on individual NZBs and Daily show naming conventions.
